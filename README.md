# MUGEN for Sublime Text 3

Language utility package for MUGEN, a fighting game engine.

## Installation

Just `git clone` it to the Packages folder. I can't be bothered to host it on packagecontrol.

## Features

- A port of all the snippets and state controllers from Fighter Factory 3. 
- Syntax highlighting for CNS/CMD/DEF and AIR
- Build commands for running MUGEN and sndmaker/sprmake2 (assuming they are on `PATH`)
- Autocomplete for state controllers and their parameters
