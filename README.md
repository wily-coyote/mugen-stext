# MUGEN for Sublime Text 3

Language utility package for MUGEN, a fighting game engine.

### Installation

Just `git clone` it to the Packages folder. I can't be bothered to host it on packagecontrol.

### Features

- A port of all the snippets and state controllers from Fighter Factory 3
- Syntax highlighting for CNS/CMD/DEF and AIR
- Build commands for running MUGEN and sndmaker/sprmake2 (config file allows you to change which version of MUGEN to run)
- Autocomplete for state controllers and their parameters

### TODO

- More snippets (things like QCB, QCF, see `kfm.cns`)

### Changelog
