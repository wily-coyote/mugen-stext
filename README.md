# MUGEN for Sublime Text 3

Language utility package for MUGEN, a fighting game engine.

### Installation

Just `git clone` it to the Packages folder. I can't be bothered to host it on packagecontrol.

### Features

- A port of all the snippets from Fighter Factory 3
- Completions for SCTRLs and triggers
- Syntax highlighting for CNS/CMD/DEF and AIR
