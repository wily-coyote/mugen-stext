# MUGEN for Sublime Text 4

Language utility package for MUGEN, a fighting game engine. Includes support for IKEMEN.

### Installation

Just `git clone` it to the Packages folder. I can't be bothered to host it on packagecontrol.

### Features

- A port of all the snippets from Fighter Factory 3
- Completions for SCTRLs and triggers
- Syntax highlighting for CNS/CMD/DEF and AIR
- Syntax highlighting for IKEMEN ZSS (Zantei State Script)
- Build targets for running MUGEN and sndmaker/sprmake2 (config file allows you to change which version of MUGEN to run)
- Build targets for running IKEMEN

### TODO

- More snippets (things like QCB, QCF, see `kfm.cns`)
